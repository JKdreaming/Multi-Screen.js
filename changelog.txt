1.0.1
- code structure overhaul
- set west as default for exit and entry
- set top .ms-container as default (if no .ms-default is specified)
- switching screens now conditional on validity of target
- added appropriate console warning messages on invalid/malformed input

1.0.2
- added initial check for at least one .ms-container before loading
- added z-index change on screen-switch to ensure no unwanted overlap

1.1.0
- added data-ms-enter-time and data-ms-exit-time attributes for control of the entry and exit speed of the screen (defaults to 500ms)

1.2.0
- added fade in and out for switch effects
- added data-ms-delay attribute for control over whether the entry animation should wait for the exit animation to finish or not (defaults to false)
- added display none to avoid problems with transparant screens

1.2.1
- increased efficiency by referencing the target screens from a stored object (on init) like the current screen, indexed by id
- require at least 2 (instead of 1) screens to run
- improved robustness by locking screen navigation while a switch is in progress

1.2.2
- added check for only one .ms-default, take the top one if more than one

1.2.3
- added a dynamic calculation of the original position of the entering screen and the distance traveled in each direction by the exiting screen (based on maximum height/width of the entering screen, exiting screen, and window size plus a buffer) to fix incoming screens coming in too soon and exiting screens to not completely leave all the way

1.3.0
- code overhaul
- added the fadetop, fadetopright, faderight, fadebottomright, fadebottom, fadebottomleft, fadeleft, and fadetopleft commands
- removed console warnings for backward compatibility
- introduction of jQuery api to set default animations, times, and delay
